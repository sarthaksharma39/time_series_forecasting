# time_series_forecasting
## A hybrid system based on ensemble learning to model residuals for time-series forecasting

Time-series forecating -> Predicting future value based on historical data organized in a time-dependant sequence.
### Ensemble learning ->
It involve combining multiple model to create a stronger, more robust model.
### Model residual ->
It involve creating a model to predict the differences which help overall system accuracy. (difference between observed value and predicted)

## TASK ->
A approach that combines different method (hybrid system) and ensemble learning technique to create a model that specifically focus on improving the accuracy of the time-series forecasting by effectively predicting the residuals.
