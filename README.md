## A HYBRID SYSTEM BASED ON ENSEMBLE LEARNING FOR TIME SERIES FORECASTING OF SOLAR IRRADIANCE

## TASK ->
A approach that combines different method (hybrid system) and ensemble learning technique to create a model that specifically focus on improving the accuracy of the time-series forecasting by effectively predicting the residuals.

#### Time-series forecating -> 
Predicting future value based on historical data organized in a time-dependant sequence.
#### Ensemble learning ->
It involve combining multiple model to create a stronger, more robust model.

### Impact: 
Advance renewable energy optimization and atmospheric science
## Problem Statement: 
Develop a hybrid forecasting system that leverages ensemble learning techniques to improve the performance of time series forecasting of solar irradiance by effectively modeling meteorological parameters.

## Future scope:
Integrate AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) data with other meteorological parameters can enhance time series prediction of solar irradiance.
